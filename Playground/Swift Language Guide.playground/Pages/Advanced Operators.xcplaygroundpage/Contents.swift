/*: # Advanced Operators
 Swift provides several advanced operators that perform more complex value manipulation. These include all of the bitwise and bit shifting operators you will be familiar with from C and Objective-C.

 Unlike arithmetic operators in C, arithmetic operators in Swift do not overflow by default. Overflow behavior is trapped and reported as an error. To opt in to overflow behavior, use Swift’s second set of arithmetic operators that overflow by default, such as the overflow addition operator (&+). All of these overflow operators begin with an ampersand (&).
 与C中的算术运算符不同，Swift中的算术运算符默认不会溢出。溢出行为被捕获并报告为错误。要选择溢出行为，使用Swift的第二组默认溢出的算术运算符，例如溢出加法运算符（＆+）。所有这些溢出运算符都以＆符号开头。
 When you define your own structures, classes, and enumerations, it can be useful to provide your own implementations of the standard Swift operators for these custom types. Swift makes it easy to provide tailored implementations of these operators and to determine exactly what their behavior should be for each type you create.

 You’re not limited to the predefined operators. Swift gives you the freedom to define your own custom infix, prefix, postfix, and assignment operators, with custom precedence and associativity values. These operators can be used and adopted in your code like any of the predefined operators, and you can even extend existing types to support the custom operators you define.

 # Bitwise Operators
 Bitwise operators enable you to manipulate the individual raw data bits within a data structure. They are often used in low-level programming, such as graphics programming and device driver creation. Bitwise operators can also be useful when you work with raw data from external sources, such as encoding and decoding data for communication over a custom protocol.
 按位运算符使您能够处理数据结构中的各个原始数据位。它们经常用于低级编程，例如图形编程和设备驱动程序创建。当使用来自外部源的原始数据（例如，通过自定义协议进行编码和解码数据）时，按位运算符也很有用。
 Swift supports all of the bitwise operators found in C, as described below.
 ## Bitwise NOT Operator
 The bitwise NOT operator (~) inverts all bits in a number:
 按位非运算符（〜）反转数字中的所有位： https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/bitwiseNOT_2x.png
 The bitwise NOT operator is a prefix operator, and appears immediately before the value it operates on, without any white space.

do {
    let initialBits: UInt8 = 0b00001111
    let invertedBits = ~initialBits // equals 11110000
    /// UInt8 integers have eight bits and can store any value between 0 and 255. This example initializes a UInt8 integer with the binary value 00001111, which has its first four bits set to 0, and its second four bits set to 1. This is equivalent to a decimal value of 15.
    /// The bitwise NOT operator is then used to create a new constant called invertedBits, which is equal to initialBits, but with all of the bits inverted. Zeros become ones, and ones become zeros. The value of invertedBits is 11110000, which is equal to an unsigned decimal value of 240.

 ## Bitwise AND Operator
 The bitwise AND operator (&) combines the bits of two numbers. It returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if the bits were equal to 1 in both input numbers: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/bitwiseAND_2x.png

 # Bitwise Left and Right Shift Operators
 按位左和右移位运算符
 The bitwise left shift operator (<<) and bitwise right shift operator (>>) move all bits in a number to the left or the right by a certain number of places, according to the rules defined below.
 根据以下定义的规则，按位左移位运算符（<<）和按位右移位运算符（>>）将数字中的所有位向左或向右移动一定数量的位置。
 Bitwise left and right shifts have the effect of multiplying or dividing an integer by a factor of two. Shifting an integer’s bits to the left by one position doubles its value, whereas shifting it to the right by one position halves its value.
 按位左移和右移具有将整数乘以因子2的效果。将整数位左移一个位置将其值加倍，而将其向右移位一个位置将其值减半.
 ### Shifting Behavior for Unsigned Integers
 无符号整数的移位行为
 The bit-shifting behavior for unsigned integers is as follows:
 - Existing bits are moved to the left or right by the requested number of places.
 - Any bits that are moved beyond the bounds of the integer’s storage are discarded.
 - Zeros are inserted in the spaces left behind after the original bits are moved to the left or right.
 This approach is known as a logical shift.这种方法被称为逻辑移位。
 The illustration below shows the results of 11111111 << 1 (which is 11111111 shifted to the left by 1 place), and 11111111 >> 1 (which is 11111111 shifted to the right by 1 place). Blue numbers are shifted, gray numbers are discarded, and orange zeros are inserted: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/bitshiftUnsigned_2x.png

    let pink: UInt32 = 0xCC6699
    let redComponent = (pink & 0xFF0000) >> 16    // redComponent is 0xCC, or 204

    let blueComponent = pink & 0x0000FF           // blueComponent is 0x99, or 153
}
/*:
 ### Shifting Behavior for Signed Integers
 The shifting behavior is more complex for signed integers than for unsigned integers, because of the way signed integers are represented in binary. (The examples below are based on 8-bit signed integers for simplicity, but the same principles apply for signed integers of any size.)
 对于有符号整数，与无符号整数相比，移位行为更复杂，因为有符号整数以二进制表示的方式。 （为了简单起见，以下示例基于8位有符号整数，但相同的原则适用于任何大小的有符号整数。）
 Signed integers use their first bit (known as the sign bit) to indicate whether the integer is positive or negative. A sign bit of 0 means positive, and a sign bit of 1 means negative.
 有符号整数使用它们的第一个位（称为符号位）来指示整数是正还是负。 符号位0表示正，符号位1表示负。
 The remaining bits (known as the value bits) store the actual value. Positive numbers are stored in exactly the same way as for unsigned integers, counting upwards from 0. Here’s how the bits inside an Int8 look for the number 4:
 剩余位（称为值位）存储实际值。 正数以与无符号整数完全相同的方式存储，从0向上计数。这是Int8中的位如何查找数4：https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/bitshiftSignedFour_2x.png
 The sign bit is 0 (meaning “positive”), and the seven value bits are just the number 4, written in binary notation.符号位是0（意味着“正”），并且七个值位只是数字4，以二进制符号表示。
 Negative numbers, however, are stored differently. They are stored by subtracting their absolute value from 2 to the power of n, where n is the number of value bits. An eight-bit number has seven value bits, so this means 2 to the power of 7, or 128.
 然而，负数存储方式不同。 它们通过将其绝对值从2减去n的幂而存储，其中n是值位的数量。 一个8位数有7个值位，所以这意味着2的7的幂，或128。
 Here’s how the bits inside an Int8 look for the number -4: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/bitshiftSignedMinusFour_2x.png
 This time, the sign bit is 1 (meaning “negative”), and the seven value bits have a binary value of 124 (which is 128 - 4): https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/bitshiftSignedMinusFourValue_2x.png
 This encoding for negative numbers is known as a two’s complement representation. It may seem an unusual way to represent negative numbers, but it has several advantages.
 First, you can add -1 to -4, simply by performing a standard binary addition of all eight bits (including the sign bit), and discarding anything that doesn’t fit in the eight bits once you’re done: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/bitshiftSignedAddition_2x.png
 Second, the two’s complement representation also lets you shift the bits of negative numbers to the left and right like positive numbers, and still end up doubling them for every shift you make to the left, or halving them for every shift you make to the right. To achieve this, an extra rule is used when signed integers are shifted to the right: When you shift signed integers to the right, apply the same rules as for unsigned integers, but fill any empty bits on the left with the sign bit, rather than with a zero.
 https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/bitshiftSigned_2x.png
 This action ensures that signed integers have the same sign after they are shifted to the right, and is known as an arithmetic shift.
 Because of the special way that positive and negative numbers are stored, shifting either of them to the right moves them closer to zero. Keeping the sign bit the same during this shift means that negative integers remain negative as their value moves closer to zero.

 # Overflow Operators
 溢流操作器
 If you try to insert a number into an integer constant or variable that cannot hold that value, by default Swift reports an error rather than allowing an invalid value to be created. This behavior gives extra safety when you work with numbers that are too large or too small.
 如果尝试将数字插入到不能容纳该值的整数常量或变量中，则默认情况下Swift报告错误，而不是允许创建无效值。当您使用太大或太小的数字时，此行为会提供额外的安全性。
 */

//    var potentialOverflow = Int16.max
    // potentialOverflow equals 32767, which is the maximum value an Int16 can hold
    //potentialOverflow += 1
    // this causes an error
}
/*:
 Providing error handling when values get too large or too small gives you much more flexibility when coding for boundary value conditions.
 However, when you specifically want an overflow condition to truncate the number of available bits, you can opt in to this behavior rather than triggering an error. Swift provides three arithmetic overflow operators that opt in to the overflow behavior for integer calculations. These operators all begin with an ampersand (&):
 - Overflow addition (&+)
 - Overflow subtraction (&-)
 - Overflow multiplication (&*)
 */

 ## Value Overflow
 Numbers can overflow in both the positive and negative direction.

//    // unsignedOverflow equals 255, which is the maximum value a UInt8 can hold
//    unsignedOverflow = unsignedOverflow &+ 1
//    // unsignedOverflow is now equal to 0
//}
/*:
The variable unsignedOverflow is initialized with the maximum value a UInt8 can hold (255, or 11111111 in binary). It is then incremented by 1 using the overflow addition operator (&+). This pushes its binary representation just over the size that a UInt8 can hold, causing it to overflow beyond its bounds, as shown in the diagram below. The value that remains within the bounds of the UInt8 after the overflow addition is 00000000, or zero.
https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/overflowAddition_2x.png
*/
do {
    var unsignedOverflow = UInt8.min
    // unsignedOverflow equals 0, which is the minimum value a UInt8 can hold
    unsignedOverflow = unsignedOverflow &- 1
    // unsignedOverflow is now equal to 255
}
/*:
 The minimum value that a UInt8 can hold is zero, or 00000000 in binary. If you subtract 1 from 00000000 using the overflow subtraction operator (&-), the number will overflow and wrap around to 11111111, or 255 in decimal.
 https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/overflowUnsignedSubtraction_2x.png
 Overflow also occurs for signed integers. All addition and subtraction for signed integers is performed in bitwise fashion, with the sign bit included as part of the numbers being added or subtracted, as described in Bitwise Left and Right Shift Operators.
 */
do {
    var signedOverflow = Int8.min
    // signedOverflow equals -128, which is the minimum value an Int8 can hold
    signedOverflow = signedOverflow &- 1
    // signedOverflow is now equal to 127
}
/*:
 The minimum value that an Int8 can hold is -128, or 10000000 in binary. Subtracting 1 from this binary number with the overflow operator gives a binary value of 01111111, which toggles the sign bit and gives positive 127, the maximum positive value that an Int8 can hold.
 https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/overflowSignedSubtraction_2x.png
 For both signed and unsigned integers, overflow in the positive direction wraps around from the maximum valid integer value back to the minimum, and overflow in the negative direction wraps around from the minimum value to the maximum.

 # Precedence and Associativity
 优先和相关性
 Operator precedence gives some operators higher priority than others; these operators are applied first.
 运算符优先级给一些运算符比其他运算符优先级高首先应用这些运算符。
 Operator associativity defines how operators of the same precedence are grouped together—either grouped from the left, or grouped from the right. Think of it as meaning “they associate with the expression to their left,” or “they associate with the expression to their right.”
 操作符关联性定义了相同优先级的操作符如何分组在一起 - 从左侧分组或从右侧分组。认为它是“他们与他们的左边的表达相关联”的意思，或者“他们与他们的权利的表达相关联。
