 # THE BASICS
 Swift is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Nonetheless, many parts of Swift will be familiar from your experience of developing in C and Objective-C.

 Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types, including Int for integers, Double and Float for floating-point values, Bool for Boolean values, and String for textual data. Swift also provides powerful versions of the three primary collection types, Array, Set, and Dictionary, as described in Collection Types.

 Like C, Swift uses variables to store and refer to values by an identifying name. Swift also makes extensive use of variables whose values cannot be changed. These are known as constants, and are much more powerful than constants in C. Constants are used throughout Swift to make code safer and clearer in intent when you work with values that do not need to change.

 In addition to familiar types, Swift introduces advanced types not found in Objective-C, such as tuples. Tuples enable you to create and pass around groupings of values. You can use a tuple to return multiple values from a function as a single compound value.

 Swift also introduces optional types, which handle the absence of a value. Optionals say either “there is a value, and it equals x” or “there isn’t a value at all”. Using optionals is similar to using nil with pointers in Objective-C, but they work for any type, not just classes. Not only are optionals safer and more expressive than nil pointers in Objective-C, they are at the heart of many of Swift’s most powerful features.

 Swift is a type-safe language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. If part of your code expects a String, type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake. Likewise, type safety prevents you from accidentally passing an optional String to a piece of code that expects a nonoptional String. Type safety helps you catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process.

 # Constants and Variables
 Constants and variables associate a name (such as maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts or welcomeMessage) with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello"). The value of a constant cannot be changed once it is set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.
 
 ## Declaring Constants and Variables

 Constants and variables must be declared before they are used. You declare constants with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword.
 
 - NOTE:
 If a stored value in your code is not going to change, always declare it as a constant with the let keyword. Use variables only for storing values that need to be able to change.
 */

    let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
    var currentLoginAttempt = 0
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0
}
/*:
 ## Type Annotations

 You can provide a type annotation when you declare a constant or variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable can store. Write a type annotation by placing a colon after the constant or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type to use.

 - NOTE:
 It is rare that you need to write type annotations in practice. If you provide an initial value for a constant or variable at the point that it is defined, Swift can almost always infer the type to be used for that constant or variable, as described in Type Safety and Type Inference. In the welcomeMessage example above, no initial value is provided, and so the type of the welcomeMessage variable is specified with a type annotation rather than being inferred from an initial value.
 */
do {
    var welcomeMessage: String
    welcomeMessage = "Hello"

 ## Naming Constants and Variables
 
 Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters.

 Once you’ve declared a constant or variable of a certain type, you can’t redeclare it again with the same name, or change it to store values of a different type. Nor can you change a constant into a variable or a variable into a constant.

 If you need to give a constant or variable the same name as a reserved Swift keyword, surround the keyword with backticks (`) when using it as a name. However, avoid using keywords as names unless you have absolutely no choice. 如果您需要给予一个常量或变量与一个保留的Swift关键字相同的名称，那么在使用它作为一个名称时，使用反引号（`）来围绕该关键字。 但是，除非你绝对没有选择，否则不要使用关键字作为名称.
 */
do {
    let `private` = "private word"
    var word = `private`
}

/*:
 ## Printing Constants and Variables

 You can print the current value of a constant or variable with the print(_:separator:terminator:) function.

 The print(_:separator:terminator:) function is a global function that prints one or more values to an appropriate output. In Xcode, for example, the print(_:separator:terminator:) function prints its output in Xcode’s “console” pane. The separator and terminator parameter have default values, so you can omit them when you call this function. By default, the function terminates the line it prints by adding a line break. To print a value without a line break after it, pass an empty string as the terminator—for example, print(someValue, terminator: ""). For information about parameters with default values, see Default Parameter Values.

 Swift uses string interpolation to include the name of a constant or variable as a placeholder in a longer string, and to prompt Swift to replace it with the current value of that constant or variable. Wrap the name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash before the opening parenthesis.

 - NOTE:

 All options you can use with string interpolation are described in String Interpolation.
 */

/*:
 # Comments

 Use comments to include nonexecutable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself. Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler when your code is compiled.

 Comments in Swift are very similar to comments in C. Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//).

 Multiline comments start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/).

 Unlike multiline comments in C, multiline comments in Swift can be nested inside other multiline comments. You write nested comments by starting a multiline comment block and then starting a second multiline comment within the first block. The second block is then closed, followed by the first block.

 Nested multiline comments enable you to comment out large blocks of code quickly and easily, even if the code already contains multiline comments.
 */
do {
    // This is a comment.

    /* This is also a comment
     but is written over multiple lines. */

    /* This is the start of the first multiline comment.
     /* This is the second, nested multiline comment. */
     This is the end of the first multiline comment.

/*:
 # Integers

 Integers are whole numbers with no fractional component, such as 42 and -23. Integers are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero).

 Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit forms. These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, in that an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type UInt8, and a 32-bit signed integer is of type Int32. Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names.

 ## Integer Bounds

 You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with its min and max properties.
 
 The values of these properties are of the appropriate-sized number type (such as UInt8 in the example below) and can therefore be used in expressions alongside other values of the same type.
 */
do {
    let minValue = UInt8.min  // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8
    let maxValue = UInt8.max  // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8
}
/*:
 ## Int

 In most cases, you don’t need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your code. Swift provides an additional integer type, Int, which has the same size as the current platform’s native word size:

    On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int32.
    On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int64.
 Unless you need to work with a specific size of integer, always use Int for integer values in your code. This aids code consistency and interoperability. Even on 32-bit platforms, Int can store any value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, and is large enough for many integer ranges.
 
 ## UInt

 Swift also provides an unsigned integer type, UInt, which has the same size as the current platform’s native word size:

    On a 32-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt32.
    On a 64-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt64.

 - NOTE:
 Use UInt only when you specifically need an unsigned integer type with the same size as the platform’s native word size. If this is not the case, Int is preferred, even when the values to be stored are known to be non-negative. A consistent use of Int for integer values aids code interoperability, avoids the need to convert between different number types, and matches integer type inference, as described in Type Safety and Type Inference. 只有当您特别需要与平台本机字大小相同大小的无符号整数类型时，才使用UInt。 如果不是这种情况，Int是首选，即使要存储的值被称为非负数。 Int对于整数值的一致使用有助于代码互操作性，避免了在不同数字类型之间转换的需要，并且匹配整数类型推断，如类型安全和类型推断中所述。
 */

/*:
 # Floating-Point Numbers

 Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component, such as 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.15.

 Floating-point types can represent a much wider range of values than integer types, and can store numbers that are much larger or smaller than can be stored in an Int. Swift provides two signed floating-point number types:

    Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number.
    Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number.

 - NOTE:
 Double has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of Float can be as little as 6 decimal digits. The appropriate floating-point type to use depends on the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code. In situations where either type would be appropriate, Double is preferred. Double的精度至少为15位十进制数，而Float的精度可以是6位十进制数。 要使用的适当浮点类型取决于您需要在代码中处理的值的性质和范围。 在任何一种类型适合的情况下，优选Double。

/*:
 # Type Safety and Type Inference

 Swift is a type-safe language. A type safe language encourages you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. If part of your code expects a String, you can’t pass it an Int by mistake. Swift是一种类型安全的语言。一种类型的安全语言鼓励您清楚代码可以使用的值的类型。如果你的一部分代码需要一个String，那么你就不能错误地传给Int。

 Because Swift is type safe, it performs type checks when compiling your code and flags any mismatched types as errors. This enables you to catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process. 因为Swift是类型安全的，它在编译代码时执行类型检查，并将任何不匹配的类型标记为错误。这使您能够在开发过程中尽可能早地捕获并修复错误。

 Type-checking helps you avoid errors when you’re working with different types of values. However, this doesn’t mean that you have to specify the type of every constant and variable that you declare. If you don’t specify the type of value you need, Swift uses type inference to work out the appropriate type. Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide. 当您使用不同类型的值时，类型检查可帮助您避免错误。但是，这并不意味着您必须指定您声明的每个常量和变量的类型。如果您没有指定所需的值类型，Swift将使用类型推断来确定适当的类型。类型推断使得编译器可以在编译代码时自动推导特定表达式的类型，只需检查您提供的值即可。

 Because of type inference, Swift requires far fewer type declarations than languages such as C or Objective-C. Constants and variables are still explicitly typed, but much of the work of specifying their type is done for you.

 Type inference is particularly useful when you declare a constant or variable with an initial value. This is often done by assigning a literal value (or literal) to the constant or variable at the point that you declare it. 当您声明具有初始值的常量或变量时，类型推断特别有用。这通常是在您声明的那一点上为常量或变量分配文字值（或文字）来完成的。
 
 Swift always chooses Double (rather than Float) when inferring the type of floating-point numbers. 当推断出浮点数的类型时，Swift总是选择Double（而不是Float）.

 If you combine integer and floating-point literals in an expression, a type of Double will be inferred from the context. 如果在表达式中组合整数和浮点数字，则会从上下文中推断出Double类型.

 # Optionals

 You use optionals in situations where a value may be absent. An optional represents two possibilities: Either there is a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value, or there isn’t a value at all. 在值可能不存在的情况下，您可以使用可选项。一个可选的代表了两种可能性：有一个值，你可以打开可选的来访问该值，或者根本没有一个值。

 - NOTE:
 The concept of optionals doesn’t exist in C or Objective-C. The nearest thing in Objective-C is the ability to return nil from a method that would otherwise return an object, with nil meaning “the absence of a valid object.” However, this only works for objects—it doesn’t work for structures, basic C types, or enumeration values. For these types, Objective-C methods typically return a special value (such as NSNotFound) to indicate the absence of a value. This approach assumes that the method’s caller knows there is a special value to test against and remembers to check for it. Swift’s optionals let you indicate the absence of a value for any type at all, without the need for special constants.C或Objective-C中不存在可选项的概念。 Objective-C中最接近的东西是从一个否则返回一个对象的方法返回nil的能力，其中nil表示“没有有效对象”。但是，这仅适用于对象 - 它不适用于结构，基本C类型或枚举值。对于这些类型，Objective-C方法通常返回一个特殊值（例如NSNotFound）来表示没有值。这种方法假设方法的调用者知道有一个特殊的值来测试和记住它来检查它。 Swift的可选项可让您指出任何类型的值都不存在，而不需要特殊的常量。

 nil cannot be used with nonoptional constants and variables. If a constant or variable in your code needs to work with the absence of a value under certain conditions, always declare it as an optional value of the appropriate type.
 

 - NOTE:
 Swift’s nil is not the same as nil in Objective-C. In Objective-C, nil is a pointer to a nonexistent object. In Swift, nil is not a pointer—it is the absence of a value of a certain type. Optionals of any type can be set to nil, not just object types. Objective-C中的Swift的零点不同于零。 在Objective-C中，nil是指向不存在对象的指针。 在Swift中，nil不是一个指针 - 它是没有某种类型的值。 任何类型的可选项可以设置为nil，而不仅仅是对象类型。

 # Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals
 隐式展开的可选项

 As described above, optionals indicate that a constant or variable is allowed to have “no value”. Optionals can be checked with an if statement to see if a value exists, and can be conditionally unwrapped with optional binding to access the optional’s value if it does exist.

 Sometimes it is clear from a program’s structure that an optional will always have a value, after that value is first set. In these cases, it is useful to remove the need to check and unwrap the optional’s value every time it is accessed, because it can be safely assumed to have a value all of the time. 有时从程序的结构中可以清楚地看到，可选项将始终具有一个值，该值首先设置为该值。在这些情况下，删除在每次访问时检查和解除可选项值的需要是有用的，因为可以安全地假定所有时间都具有值。

 These kinds of optionals are defined as implicitly unwrapped optionals. You write an implicitly unwrapped optional by placing an exclamation mark (String!) rather than a question mark (String?) after the type that you want to make optional. 这些可选项定义为隐式解包选项。通过在想要选择的类型之后放置一个感叹号（String！）而不是一个问号（String？）来编写一个隐式解开的可选项。

 Implicitly unwrapped optionals are useful when an optional’s value is confirmed to exist immediately after the optional is first defined and can definitely be assumed to exist at every point thereafter. The primary use of implicitly unwrapped optionals in Swift is during class initialization, as described in Unowned References and Implicitly Unwrapped Optional Properties. 当可选的值在第一次定义可选项之后立即确认存在可选值时，隐式展开的可选项是有用的，并且可以肯定地假设存在于其后的每个点。在Swift中主要使用隐式解包的可选项是在类初始化期间，如“未知引用”和“隐式解包”可选属性中所述。

 An implicitly unwrapped optional is a normal optional behind the scenes, but can also be used like a nonoptional value, without the need to unwrap the optional value each time it is accessed. The following example shows the difference in behavior between an optional string and an implicitly unwrapped optional string when accessing their wrapped value as an explicit String. 隐式解开的可选项是幕后的常规可选选项，但也可以像非选用值一样使用，无需在每次访问时解除可选的值。以下示例显示了在将其包装值作为显式字符串访问时，可选字符串与隐式解除的可选字符串之间的行为差​​异.
 */
let possibleString: String? = "An optional string."
let forcedString: String = possibleString! // requires an exclamation mark

let assumedString: String! = "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."
let implicitString: String = assumedString // no need for an exclamation mark
/*:
 You can think of an implicitly unwrapped optional as giving permission for the optional to be unwrapped automatically whenever it is used. Rather than placing an exclamation mark after the optional’s name each time you use it, you place an exclamation mark after the optional’s type when you declare it. 您可以将隐式解包的可选作为给予权限，使其可以自动被自动解包。 在每次使用可选名称之后，不要在可选名称之后放置一个感叹号，而是在您声明该选项后的类型之后放置一个感叹号。

 - NOTE:
 If an implicitly unwrapped optional is nil and you try to access its wrapped value, you’ll trigger a runtime error. The result is exactly the same as if you place an exclamation mark after a normal optional that does not contain a value. 如果隐式解除的可选项为nil，并尝试访问其包装值，则会触发运行时错误。 结果与在不包含值的常规可选项之后放置感叹号完全相同。

 Do not use an implicitly unwrapped optional when there is a possibility of a variable becoming nil at a later point. Always use a normal optional type if you need to check for a nil value during the lifetime of a variable. 当有可能的变量在以后变为零时，不要使用隐式解开的可选。 如果需要在变量生命周期内检查一个零值，请始终使用正常的可选类型。

 # Error Handling

 You use error handling to respond to error conditions your program may encounter during execution.

 In contrast to optionals, which can use the presence or absence of a value to communicate success or failure of a function, error handling allows you to determine the underlying cause of failure, and, if necessary, propagate the error to another part of your program. 与可选项相反，可以使用值的存在或不存在来传达功能的成功或失败，错误处理允许您确定故障的根本原因，如有必要，将错误传播到程序的另一部分。

 When a function encounters an error condition, it throws an error. That function’s caller can then catch the error and respond appropriately. 当函数遇到错误条件时，会引发错误。 那个函数的调用者可以捕获错误并作出适当的响应。
 
 A function indicates that it can throw an error by including the throws keyword in its declaration. When you call a function that can throw an error, you prepend the try keyword to the expression. 一个函数表示它可以通过在其声明中包含throws关键字来引发错误。 当你调用一个可以引发错误的函数时，你可以在表达式中添加try关键字。

 Swift automatically propagates errors out of their current scope until they are handled by a catch clause. Swift自动将错误传播到当前范围之外，直到被catch子句处理。
 
 A do statement creates a new containing scope, which allows errors to be propagated to one or more catch clauses. do语句创建一个新的包含范围，允许将错误传播到一个或多个catch子句。

 # Assertions
 断言

 In some cases, it is simply not possible for your code to continue execution if a particular condition is not satisfied. In these situations, you can trigger an assertion in your code to end code execution and to provide an opportunity to debug the cause of the absent or invalid value. 在某些情况下，如果特定条件不满足，您的代码根本无法继续执行。在这些情况下，您可以在代码中触发断言以结束代码执行，并提供调试缺失值或无效值的原因的机会。

 ## Debugging with Assertions

 An assertion is a runtime check that a Boolean condition definitely evaluates to true. Literally put, an assertion “asserts” that a condition is true. You use an assertion to make sure that an essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code. If the condition evaluates to true, code execution continues as usual; if the condition evaluates to false, code execution ends, and your app is terminated. 一个断言是一个运行时检查，一个布尔条件绝对评估为真。一个断言“断言”一个条件是真实的。在执行任何其他代码之前，您使用断言确保满足基本条件。如果条件评估为真，代码执行按照惯例继续执行;如果条件评估为false，则代码执行结束，并且您的应用程序被终止。

 If your code triggers an assertion while running in a debug environment, such as when you build and run an app in Xcode, you can see exactly where the invalid state occurred and query the state of your app at the time that the assertion was triggered. An assertion also lets you provide a suitable debug message as to the nature of the assert. 如果您的代码在调试环境中运行时触发断言，例如在Xcode中构建和运行应用程序时，您可以确定发生无效状态的位置，并在断言被触发时查询应用程序的状态。断言还允许您提供关于断言本质的适当调试信息。

 You write an assertion by calling the Swift standard library global assert(_:_:file:line:) function. You pass this function an expression that evaluates to true or false and a message that should be displayed if the result of the condition is false. 您通过调用Swift标准库全局assert（_：_：file：line :)函数来写入断言。您传递此函数的一个表达式，其计算结果为true或false，如果条件的结果为false，则应显示该消息.
 

 - NOTE:
 Assertions are disabled when your code is compiled with optimizations, such as when building with an app target’s default Release configuration in Xcode.

do {
    let age = -3
    //assert(age >= 0, "A person's age cannot be less than zero")
    // this causes the assertion to trigger, because age is not >= 0

}

/*:
 ## When to Use Assertions

 Use an assertion whenever a condition has the potential to be false, but must definitely be true in order for your code to continue execution. Suitable scenarios for an assertion check include:

 - An integer subscript index is passed to a custom subscript implementation, but the subscript index value could be too low or too high.
 - A value is passed to a function, but an invalid value means that the function cannot fulfill its task.
 - An optional value is currently nil, but a non-nil value is essential for subsequent code to execute successfully.

 - NOTE:
 Assertions cause your app to terminate and are not a substitute for designing your code in such a way that invalid conditions are unlikely to arise. Nonetheless, in situations where invalid conditions are possible, an assertion is an effective way to ensure that such conditions are highlighted and noticed during development, before your app is published. 断言导致您的应用程序终止，并且不能替代设计您的代码，使得无法产生无效的条件。 然而，在无效条件可能的情况下，断言是在应用程序发布之前确保在开发过程中突出显示和注意到这些条件的有效方法。
