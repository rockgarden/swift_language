 # Collection Types
 Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for storing collections of values. Arrays are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.
 https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/CollectionTypes_intro_2x.png
 Arrays, sets, and dictionaries in Swift are always clear about the types of values and keys that they can store. This means that you cannot insert a value of the wrong type into a collection by mistake. It also means you can be confident about the type of values you will retrieve from a collection.
 - NOTE:
 Swift’s array, set, and dictionary types are implemented as generic collections.
 - NOTE:
 For more information about using Array with Foundation and Cocoa, see https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WorkingWithCocoaDataTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH6 in https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216.

/*: 
 # Mutability of Collections
 If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection that is created will be mutable. This means that you can change (or mutate) the collection after it is created by adding, removing, or changing items in the collection. If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents cannot be changed.
 - NOTE:
 It is good practice to create immutable collections in all cases where the collection does not need to change. Doing so makes it easier for you to reason about your code and enables the Swift compiler to optimize the performance of the collections you create.

 ## Array Type Shorthand Syntax
 The type of a Swift array is written in full as Array<Element>, where Element is the type of values the array is allowed to store. You can also write the type of an array in shorthand form as [Element]. Although the two forms are functionally identical, the shorthand form is preferred and is used throughout this guide when referring to the type of an array.

//: # Sets
/*:
 - NOTE:
 Swift’s Set type is bridged to Foundation’s NSSet class.
 */

//: ## Hash Values for Set Types
/*:
 A type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set—that is, the type must provide a way to compute a hash value for itself. A hash value is an Int value that is the same for all objects that compare equally, such that if a == b, it follows that a.hashValue == b.hashValue.
 All of Swift’s basic types (such as String, Int, Double, and Bool) are hashable by default, and can be used as set value types or dictionary key types. Enumeration case values without associated values (as described in Enumerations) are also hashable by default.
 - NOTE:
 You can use your own custom types as set value types or dictionary key types by making them conform to the Hashable protocol from Swift’s standard library. Types that conform to the Hashable protocol must provide a gettable Int property called hashValue. The value returned by a type’s hashValue property is not required to be the same across different executions of the same program, or in different programs.
 Because the Hashable protocol conforms to Equatable, conforming types must also provide an implementation of the equals operator (==). The Equatable protocol requires any conforming implementation of == to be an equivalence relation. That is, an implementation of == must satisfy the following three conditions, for all values a, b, and c:
 a == a (Reflexivity 自反性)
 a == b implies b == a (Symmetry 对称性)
 a == b && b == c implies a == c (Transitivity 传递性)
 For more information about conforming to protocols, see [Next](@https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID267.)
 */

//: ## Set Type Syntax
//: The type of a Swift set is written as Set<Element>, where Element is the type that the set is allowed to store. Unlike arrays, sets do not have an equivalent shorthand form.

//: ## Creating and Initializing an Empty Set
do {
    var letters = Set<Character>()
    /// The type of the letters variable is inferred to be Set<Character>, from the type of the initializer.
    print("letters is of type Set<Character> with \(letters.count) items.")
    letters.insert("a")
    // letters now contains 1 value of type Character
    letters = []
    // letters is now an empty set, but is still of type Set<Character>
}

//: ## Creating a Set with an Array Literal
var favoriteGenres: Set<String> = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
do {
    /// A set type cannot be inferred from an array literal alone, so the type Set must be explicitly declared. However, because of Swift’s type inference, you don’t have to write the type of the set if you’re initializing it with an array literal containing values of the same type. The initialization of favoriteGenres could have been written in a shorter form instead:
    var favoriteGenres: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
}

//: ## Accessing and Modifying a Set
do {
    print("I have \(favoriteGenres.count) favorite music genres.")

    if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
        print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
    } else {
        print("I have particular music preferences.")
    }

    favoriteGenres.insert("Jazz")

    if let removedGenre = favoriteGenres.remove("Rock") {
        print("\(removedGenre)? I'm over it.")
    } else {
        print("I never much cared for that.")
    }

    if favoriteGenres.contains("Funk") {
        print("I get up on the good foot.")
    } else {
        print("It's too funky in here.")
    }
