 # Control Flow
 Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include while loops to perform a task multiple times; if, guard, and switch statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as break and continue to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code. Swift提供了各种控制流程语句。 这些包括多次执行任务的while循环; if，guard和switch语句根据某些条件执行不同的代码分支; 和断言等继续将执行流程转移到代码中的另一点。

 Swift also provides a for-in loop that makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences.

 Swift’s switch statement is considerably more powerful than its counterpart in many C-like languages. Cases can match many different patterns, including interval matches, tuples, and casts to a specific type. Matched values in a switch case can be bound to temporary constants or variables for use within the case’s body, and complex matching conditions can be expressed with a where clause for each case. Swift的switch语句比许多类C语言的语言更强大。 案例可以匹配许多不同的模式，包括间隔匹配，元组和转换为特定类型。 switch case 中写的匹配值可以绑定到临时常量或变量以供在案例体内使用，复杂的匹配条件可以用每个案例的where子句表示。

 # While Loops

 A while loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false. These kinds of loops are best used when the number of iterations is not known before the first iteration begins. while循环执行一组语句，直到条件变为false。 当在第一次迭代开始之前不知道迭代次数时，最好使用这些循环。
 Swift provides two kinds of while loops:
 - while evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop. 同时在每次通过循环的开始时评估其状态。
 - repeat-while evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.
 
 ## While

 A while loop starts by evaluating a single condition. If the condition is true, a set of statements is repeated until the condition becomes false.

 Here’s the general form of a while loop:

    while condition {
        statements
    }

 ## Repeat-While

 The other variation of the while loop, known as the repeat-while loop, performs a single pass through the loop block first, before considering the loop’s condition. It then continues to repeat the loop until the condition is false. while循环的另一个变体，被称为repeat-while循环，在考虑循环的条件之前首先执行循环块的单次循环。然后继续重复循环，直到条件为假。

 The repeat-while loop in Swift is analogous to a do-while loop in other languages. Swift中的repeat-while循环类似于其他语言中的do-while循环。

 # Conditional Statements

 It is often useful to execute different pieces of code based on certain conditions. You might want to run an extra piece of code when an error occurs, or to display a message when a value becomes too high or too low. To do this, you make parts of your code conditional.

 Swift provides two ways to add conditional branches to your code: the if statement and the switch statement. Typically, you use the if statement to evaluate simple conditions with only a few possible outcomes. The switch statement is better suited to more complex conditions with multiple possible permutations and is useful in situations where pattern matching can help select an appropriate code branch to execute.

 ## If

 In its simplest form, the if statement has a single if condition. It executes a set of statements only if that condition is true.
 
 You can chain multiple if statements together to consider additional clauses.

 The final else clause is optional, however, and can be excluded if the set of conditions does not need to be complete.

/*:
 ## Switch

 A switch statement considers a value and compares it against several possible matching patterns. It then executes an appropriate block of code, based on the first pattern that matches successfully. A switch statement provides an alternative to the if statement for responding to multiple potential states.

 In its simplest form, a switch statement compares a value against one or more values of the same type.

    switch some value to consider {
    case value 1:
        respond to value 1
    case value 2, value 3:
        respond to value 2 or 3
    default:
        otherwise, do something else
    }

 Every switch statement consists of multiple possible cases, each of which begins with the case keyword. In addition to comparing against specific values, Swift provides several ways for each case to specify more complex matching patterns. These options are described later in this chapter.

 Like the body of an if statement, each case is a separate branch of code execution. The switch statement determines which branch should be selected. This procedure is known as switching on the value that is being considered.

 Every switch statement must be exhaustive. That is, every possible value of the type being considered must be matched by one of the switch cases. If it’s not appropriate to provide a case for every possible value, you can define a default case to cover any values that are not addressed explicitly. This default case is indicated by the default keyword, and must always appear last. 每个开关语句都必须详尽无遗。也就是说，所考虑的类型的每个可能的值必须由一个开关情况匹配。如果不适合为每个可能的值提供案例，您可以定义一个默认大小写，以覆盖未明确解决的任何值。默认情况下，默认关键字显示，必须始终显示在最后。

/*:
 ## No Implicit Fallthrough 没有隐含的落差

 In contrast with switch statements in C and Objective-C, switch statements in Swift do not fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one by default. Instead, the entire switch statement finishes its execution as soon as the first matching switch case is completed, without requiring an explicit break statement. This makes the switch statement safer and easier to use than the one in C and avoids executing more than one switch case by mistake. 与C和Objective-C中的开关语句相反，Swift中的switch语句默认不会落在每种情况的底部，而不是下一个。 相反，只要第一个匹配的switch case完成，整个switch语句就会完成其执行，而不需要显式的break语句。 这使得switch语句比C中的语句更安全，更容易使用，并避免错误地执行多个switch情况。
 
 No need for break, and every case must have some code.

 - NOTE:
 Although break is not required in Swift, you can use a break statement to match and ignore a particular case or to break out of a matched case before that case has completed its execution. 虽然在Swift中不需要break，但是在这种情况完成执行之前，您可以使用break语句来匹配和忽略特定的情况，或者从匹配的案例中删除。For details, see Break in a Switch Statement.

 ## Compound Cases 复合案例

 Multiple switch cases that share the same body can be combined by writing several patterns after case, with a comma between each of the patterns. If any of the patterns match, then the case is considered to match. The patterns can be written over multiple lines if the list is long. 共享相同身体的多个开关盒可以通过在案例之后写入几个模式，每个模式之间以逗号组合。 如果任何一种模式匹配，则认为这种情况是匹配的。 如果列表很长，模式可以写在多行上。

/*: 
 Compound cases can also include value bindings. All of the patterns of a compound case have to include the same set of value bindings, and each binding has to get a value of the same type from all of the patterns in the compound case. This ensures that, no matter which part of the compound case matched, the code in the body of the case can always access a value for the bindings and that the value always has the same type. 
 
 复合案例还可以包括值绑定。复合案例的所有模式必须包含相同的值绑定集合，并且每个绑定必须从复合大小写中的所有模式获取相同类型的值。这可以确保，无论组合案例的哪一部分匹配，案件正文中的代码都可以随时访问绑定的值，并且该值始终具有相同的类型。

 # Control Transfer Statements

 Control transfer statements change the order in which your code is executed, by transferring control from one piece of code to another. Swift has five control transfer statements:

    continue
    break
    fallthrough 下通
    return
    throw

 The continue, break, and fallthrough statements are described below. The return statement is described in Functions, and the throw statement is described in Propagating Errors Using Throwing Functions.

 ## Continue

 The continue statement tells a loop to stop what it is doing and start again at the beginning of the next iteration through the loop. It says “I am done with the current loop iteration” without leaving the loop altogether.

        }
    }
    print(puzzleOutput)
    // Prints "grtmndsthnklk"
}

/*:
 ## Break

 The break statement ends execution of an entire control flow statement immediately. The break statement can be used inside a switch or loop statement when you want to terminate the execution of the switch or loop statement earlier than would otherwise be the case.

 ## Break in a Loop Statement

 When used inside a loop statement, break ends the loop’s execution immediately and transfers control to the code after the loop’s closing brace (}). No further code from the current iteration of the loop is executed, and no further iterations of the loop are started.

 ## Break in a Switch Statement

 When used inside a switch statement, break causes the switch statement to end its execution immediately and to transfer control to the code after the switch statement’s closing brace (}).

 This behavior can be used to match and ignore one or more cases in a switch statement. Because Swift’s switch statement is exhaustive and does not allow empty cases, it is sometimes necessary to deliberately match and ignore a case in order to make your intentions explicit. You do this by writing the break statement as the entire body of the case you want to ignore. When that case is matched by the switch statement, the break statement inside the case ends the switch statement’s execution immediately. 此行为可用于匹配和忽略switch语句中的一个或多个情况。因为Swift的切换语句是详尽无遗的，不允许空的情况，有时需要故意匹配和忽略一个案例，以使您的意图明确。您可以通过将break语句写入您想要忽略的整个案例来执行此操作。当这种情况与switch语句匹配时，case中的break语句会立即结束switch语句的执行。

 - NOTE:
 A switch case that contains only a comment is reported as a compile-time error. Comments are not statements and do not cause a switch case to be ignored. Always use a break statement to ignore a switch case.

do {
    let numberSymbol: Character = "三"  // Chinese symbol for the number 3

        print("The integer value of \(numberSymbol) is \(integerValue).")
    } else {
        print("An integer value could not be found for \(numberSymbol).")
    }
    // Prints "The integer value of 三 is 3."
}

/*:
 ## Fallthrough

 In Swift, switch statements don’t fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one. That is, the entire switch statement completes its execution as soon as the first matching case is completed. By contrast, C requires you to insert an explicit break statement at the end of every switch case to prevent fallthrough. Avoiding default fallthrough means that Swift switch statements are much more concise and predictable than their counterparts in C, and thus they avoid executing multiple switch cases by mistake.

 If you need C-style fallthrough behavior, you can opt in to this behavior on a case-by-case basis with the fallthrough keyword. The example below uses fallthrough to create a textual description of a number.
 */

    let integerToDescribe = 5
    var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"
    switch integerToDescribe {
    case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
        description += " a prime number, and also"
        fallthrough
    default:
        description += " an integer."
    }
    print(description)
    // Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."
}

/*:
 ## Labeled Statements

 In Swift, you can nest loops and conditional statements inside other loops and conditional statements to create complex control flow structures. However, loops and conditional statements can both use the break statement to end their execution prematurely. Therefore, it is sometimes useful to be explicit about which loop or conditional statement you want a break statement to terminate. Similarly, if you have multiple nested loops, it can be useful to be explicit about which loop the continue statement should affect. 在Swift中，您可以将循环和条件语句嵌套在其他循环和条件语句中，以创建复杂的控制流结构。但是，循环和条件语句都可以使用break语句来提前结束执行。因此，有意义的是明确地说明要使用break语句终止哪个循环或条件语句。类似地，如果您有多个嵌套循环，那么明确说明continue语句应该影响哪个循环是有用的。

 To achieve these aims, you can mark a loop statement or conditional statement with a statement label. With a conditional statement, you can use a statement label with the break statement to end the execution of the labeled statement. With a loop statement, you can use a statement label with the break or continue statement to end or continue the execution of the labeled statement. 要实现这些目标，您可以使用语句标签来标记循环语句或条件语句。使用条件语句，您可以使用带有break语句的语句标签来结束标记语句的执行。使用循环语句，您可以使用带有break或continue语句的语句标签来结束或继续执行带标签的语句。

 A labeled statement is indicated by placing a label on the same line as the statement’s introducer keyword, followed by a colon. Here’s an example of this syntax for a while loop, although the principle is the same for all loops and switch statements:

    label name: while condition {
        statements
    }

 The following example uses the break and continue statements with a labeled while loop for an adapted version of the Snakes and Ladders game that you saw earlier in this chapter. This time around, the game has an extra rule:

 To win, you must land exactly on square 25.
 If a particular dice roll would take you beyond square 25, you must roll again until you roll the exact number needed to land on square 25.
 */
do {
    let finalSquare = 25

    board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
    board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08

    var square = 0
    var diceRoll = 0

    gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
        diceRoll += 1
        if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
        switch square + diceRoll {
        case finalSquare:
            // diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over
            break gameLoop
        case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
            // diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again
            continue gameLoop
        default:
            // this is a valid move, so find out its effect
            square += diceRoll
            square += board[square]
        }
    }
    print("Game over!")
}
/*:
 - NOTE:

 If the break statement above did not use the gameLoop label, it would break out of the switch statement, not the while statement. Using the gameLoop label makes it clear which control statement should be terminated.

 It is not strictly necessary to use the gameLoop label when calling continue gameLoop to jump to the next iteration of the loop. There is only one loop in the game, and therefore no ambiguity as to which loop the continue statement will affect. However, there is no harm in using the gameLoop label with the continue statement. Doing so is consistent with the label’s use alongside the break statement and helps make the game’s logic clearer to read and understand.

 # Early Exit

 A guard statement, like an if statement, executes statements depending on the Boolean value of an expression. You use a guard statement to require that a condition must be true in order for the code after the guard statement to be executed. Unlike an if statement, a guard statement always has an else clause—the code inside the else clause is executed if the condition is not true. 一个保护语句，就像一个if语句，根据表达式的布尔值执行语句。 您使用guard语句要求条件必须为true，以便执行guard语句后的代码。 与if语句不同，保护语句总是有一个else子句，如果条件不成立，则执行else子句中的代码。

 # Checking API Availability

 Swift has built-in support for checking API availability, which ensures that you don’t accidentally use APIs that are unavailable on a given deployment target.

 The compiler uses availability information in the SDK to verify that all of the APIs used in your code are available on the deployment target specified by your project. Swift reports an error at compile time if you try to use an API that isn’t available.

 You use an availability condition in an if or guard statement to conditionally execute a block of code, depending on whether the APIs you want to use are available at runtime. The compiler uses the information from the availability condition when it verifies that the APIs in that block of code are available.
 
 The availability condition above specifies that in iOS, the body of the if statement executes only in iOS 10 and later; in macOS, only in macOS 10.12 and later. The last argument, *, is required and specifies that on any other platform, the body of the if executes on the minimum deployment target specified by your target.

 In its general form, the availability condition takes a list of platform names and versions. You use platform names such as iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS—for the full list, see Declaration Attributes. In addition to specifying major version numbers like iOS 8 or macOS 10.10, you can specify minor versions numbers like iOS 8.3 and macOS 10.10.3.

    if #available(platform name version, ..., *) {
        statements to execute if the APIs are available
    } else {
        fallback statements to execute if the APIs are unavailable
